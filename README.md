# Cammit App ‚Äì Focus Timer with Face Detection

Cammit is a **face-tracking focus timer** built using SwiftUI for macOS. It boosts productivity by detecting your presence via the camera and automatically pausing the timer when you're away. This app was developed as part of my internship at **Sedin Technologies**.
